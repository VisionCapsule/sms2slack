The Challenge
We're building a Cryptocurrency, with a supporting blockchain and a digital wallet. This is a pretty ambitious goal, so let's unpack that a bit. We'll have to:

Create a server to manage our custom blockchain
Implement our new Cryptocurrency on our blockchain
Create a wallet that allows us to transfer our currency between parties
This all means we need at least 3 components to this project: 1) a custom blockchain, and 2) a custom Cryptocurrency and 3) a digital wallet.

The Challenge this week is to build a custom Cryptocurrency using the JavaScript blockchain that we made last session.
